# Sensor Networks CEID Project

> Implemented and Tested some algorithms on a set of simulated motes using the Contiki Operating System and the Cooja Platform. <br>
> To run the simulations, Contiki-ng and the Cooja Platform are required.

# Exercise 1
Involves the testing of differnet motes while running a simple "hello world" program.

# Exercise 2
Implemented a basic algorithm which counts from 0 to 7 in binary and translates the current number into a sequence of toggled mote leds.

# Exercise 3
Used the energest module to calculate the energy consumption of each sensor in a sensor network. The final Plots can be seen by compiling the ploting.py script.

# Exercise 4
Modified the nullnet broadcast code to work in a send packet - acknowledge packet arrival fashion, for sensor networks containing two nodes only.
